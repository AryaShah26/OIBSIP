# Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my internship projects at Oasis Infobyte, where I worked on various Python programming tasks. Below is a brief overview of each project:

### 1. Voice Assistant
A Python-based voice assistant that utilizes speech recognition and natural language processing to perform various tasks. The assistant is capable of responding to voice commands and executing actions like providing information, opening applications, and more.

**Dependencies:**
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3

### 2. BMI Calculator
A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes user inputs for weight and height and calculates the BMI. The application then categorizes the BMI result into different health categories.

### 3. Random Password Generator
A Python script for generating strong and random passwords. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, and the script generates a secure password accordingly.

### 4. Basic Weather App
An elementary weather application that fetches real-time weather information based on user-provided location data. The app utilizes an external weather API to retrieve current weather conditions.

**Dependencies:**
- requests

### 5. Chat Application
A basic chat application built using Python, incorporating socket programming for communication between a server and multiple clients. Users can connect to the server and engage in real-time text-based communication.

**Dependencies:**
- socket
